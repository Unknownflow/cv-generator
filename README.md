# CV generator

The main goal of this project was to create a CV generator using ReactJS. The CV generator consists of two main sections: the entry section and the visualisation section. In the entry section, the users can input, edit and delete their personal details, eduation and work experiences. All of these information will be rendered in real time in the visualisation section.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
